# Tip-Of-My-Ear 

A fun game based on jeopardy, but it's music instead of phrases. 2 contestants compete using their music knowledge and try to guess the music clip and gain points. They are given 6 genres to choose from, and multiple decades per genre. There are 5 difficulties with increasing points. Listen to the music clip and guess the name of the song. If you get it right, you get the points, no points for not guessing and negative points for getting it wrong. There is high risk high reward here! So get your musical bone to work and guess away if the song was on the tip of your ear.

## How to play?
1. Allows a player to enter their details, which are then authenticated to ensure that they are an authorised player.
2. Players are asked to select the genre of their liking and start the round.
3. Selects a song from the catalogue.
4. Allows the user up to guess the song after listening to a 30 seconds long audio clip and album art.
5. If the guess is correct, add the points to the player’s score, no points for no guess and negative points for incorrect guess.
6. Displays the number of points the player has when the game ends.
7. The player with the most points wins the game and bragging rights.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
