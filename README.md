# Tip-Of-My-Ear

A fun game based on jeopardy, but it's music instead of phrases. 4 contestants compete using their music knowledge and try to guess the music clip and gain points. They are given 4 genres to choose from, and multiple decades per genre. There are 5 difficulties with increasing points. The length of the clips grow longer if the player is not able to guess first time, but the points decrease too! Guess incorrectly 2 times and you get negative the points that you were originally gonna get.
